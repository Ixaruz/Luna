## How-To

1. do the thing (Building) or grab a [release](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna-ovl/releases/latest).
2. put everything on the SD card and provide 1.10.0 [**DECRYPTED**](https://github.com/Ixaruz/HorizonCrypt/releases/latest) save as template.
3. run overlay when you're on a dream island.
4. grab the dump from your SD card.
5. [**ENCRYPT**](https://github.com/Ixaruz/HorizonCrypt/releases/latest) dump and fix file hashes.
7. ???
8. Profit. 

## Building
1. Requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/)
2. Requires switch-dev, switch-freetype, switch-zlib
## Known Issues

- Non-ASCII island names can't be saved (e.g. Japanese/Chinese/Korean/Russian, basically every language that doesnt use the roman alphabet.)
  this is due to Nintendo Switch handling file paths in Shift JIS (basically utf8), which doesn't include non-ASCII characters.
  I wont be able to fix this. Currently Luna just doesn't include the island name in the path, if its invalid, you can still dump foreign islands, duh.

- If you want to go online with dumped dream towns and avoid error 2219-3003 ("Network temporarily unavailable"),
  check this [release](https://github.com/Ixaruz/Luna/releases/tag/0.4.1).
